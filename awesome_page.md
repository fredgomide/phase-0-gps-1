### GitHub Markdown - Small conflict change master


GitHub has many features that make it **stand out** in *version control*.

Along with your commit message, you can:
1. Expand on your PR in the comment box
2. Tag other GitHub users
3. Insert Emojis
4. Use word notation
5. Quote code like this

'git commit'

or

'''
git status
git add .
git push
'''

This is what makes [GitHub](https://github.com/) a multi-million dollar company!
