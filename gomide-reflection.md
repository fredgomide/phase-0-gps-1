### Reflection GPS 1.1

Answer these questions in your reflection:

What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
It was little confusing for me from where to pull and from where to push the commits made. Specially pushing it to GitHub. I guess it's a little bit more clear now, and I believe that with practice I'll sort this for good.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Merging conflicts was something I wasnt really sure on how to resolve and now, it cool.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? Questions about pushing the commits from branch to master.

What still confuses you about Git?
The difference from git pull and git fetch. I guess one pull everything from the repo and merge it with you master and the other you'd have to choose what to merge. But i'm not sure if thats, correct.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? I didnt pair in this GPS, but paired on other assignements. Its a great experience whatching someone trying to solve the same problens you have but trhough another point of view.
